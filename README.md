yes i hasan yildirim made this website. with a little help of chatgpd.

beware, the site is still in construction, the idea of the sites functionality is that any website viewer can make custom cards on it,
with frontside questions and backside solution on each card, simply click the card to view the solution when you feel like it.

add data to a card from the inputfield, see if you can figure out the solution which is on other data file.
hope this explains it in simple terms.
